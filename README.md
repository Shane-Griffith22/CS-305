Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client for this assignment was a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial was seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications with this project.



What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

To identify sotware security requirements, a vulnerability check was ran and a report was generated within the program. It's important to code securely to reduce the chance of exposing the code to vulnerabilites later in the project lifecycle. Software Security adds safety and protection to a company's wellbeing, as well as giving them peace of mind that their information is safe and secure.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found this process both challenging and helpful. For my first exposure to this, there was a lot that had to be done with the configuration of the project to produce the results that were ultimately helpful in assesing the vulnerability in the system. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

In order to increase the overall security of the system, a sha-256 hash function was developed in conjunction with a secure SSL connection for the client to access the server. In the future, I find that utilizing the dependency vulnerability tool and researching to keep up with industry standards would be how I handle mitigation techniques for future projects. 


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

In order to verify system functionality, the system specification was used to crossreference the system functions with the results of the program being exeucted. A vulnerability check was used to verify system security to verify that there were no known vulnerabilities with the system. A secure connection was also established to verify the program can communicate securely through SSL-TLS on client/Server connection ports. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The more relavent resource that I used in this project was the Spring framework Wiki. This helped me tremendously with understanding how an application needs to be configured to take advantage of this tool. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

From this assignmnet, I would want to showcase the demonstrated skill I have for creating secure connections for applications that require client/server communications through the spring framework.
